Welcome to the “Moves” web application. The code for this web app returns HTML files based on the request. It uses a framework written in Python, called Flask, to allow us to skip over having to implement basic features. The CS50 IDE has the flask package pre-installed with variables and functions defined in the flask package’s code. In the CS50 IDE, the user can run flask run. (flask is also the name of a program that runs from the command-line, that looks for our application.py file and runs it for us.) Upon doing so, the user can visit our application routes by clicking the link in the IDE, and see the pages we’ve created.
After loading the page by running flask run, you must register for an account and see the events that will load on our website’s index page. After registering, you can search for events in your area, add events to our master database (written in SQL), sign up for events that were registered by others, search for new events, and even look up events via Google.
